# Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction_Data_Science
A supervised Machine Learning classification project based on the Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset.
The goal of this project is to analyze and model lifestyle and clinical health data in order to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease in individuals.

The project covers the complete Data Science workflow, including:
	•	Data exploration and preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering, handling outliers)
	•	Model training and evaluation using multiple classification algorithms
	•	Performance comparison based on metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
	•	Feature importance analysis to interpret which lifestyle factors contribute most to the prediction

This project demonstrates the practical use of Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib) for predictive health analytics and aims to show how data-driven methods can help identify key risk indicators for cardiovascular disease.
